# Juan-Meme-Generator
## An app that generates Juan-like memes googling "Animals stuck in weird places" and adding a common spanish name. LOL

Welcome to Juan Meme Generator v1.0 made by Federico Rasi
This app can make weird images similar to the horse 'Juan Meme'

Just run the file, then you can choose if you want to save or only show your image.

If you want to save it you need to type in a path. For example: "C:\Users\Username\Desktop"
Then the programm will save your image as <NAME OF THE ANIMAL>.jpg. For example "Carlos.jpg or Pablo.jpg"

# Here are some examples!

![Alt text](/ExampleImages/Albert.jpg?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](/ExampleImages/Antonio.jpg?raw=true "Title")
![Alt text](/ExampleImages/Miguel.jpg?raw=true "Title")
